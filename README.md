# Universal-Crater-Detection-with-SAM

## Description
This project introduces a novel approach to crater detection in planetary exploration using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). By leveraging SAM's prompt-able segmentation system with zero-shot generalization capabilities, our method enables universal applicability across diverse datasets and celestial bodies.

## Features
- Universal applicability for crater detection across various planetary datasets.
- Efficient geological analysis and age estimation.
- Facilitates mission planning across different celestial bodies.

## Technologies Used
- Segment Anything Model (SAM)
- Python
- Computer Vision Libraries

## Getting Started
1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Run the main script to start detecting craters.
